Agent 3 Prompt — Implement Opus Agenda UI (Simplified)

Context

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind.

Existing services (DO NOT break): calendarService, salesforceService, geminiService, PrepSheetView, ChatModal.

Goal: Match the attached UI mockup but simplified for MVP. Only the Agenda tab should function.

Requirements / Acceptance Criteria

Rename

Change branding in the UI from “AE Partner” to “Opus” everywhere.

Navigation Tabs

Tabs shown: Agenda | Pipeline | Tasks | Coach | Insights.

Only Agenda tab should be functional; the others are static placeholders (non-clickable).

Agenda Tab Behavior

Default state:

Show “Good morning, {firstName}” greeting.

Show Agenda list on the left.

Show Insights and Partner Circle (voice circle) on the right.

When the user clicks the Agenda tab:

The “Good morning, {firstName}” greeting disappears.

The Agenda list remains pinned to the left.

When the user clicks on an event in the agenda:

Generate and display a Call Prep Sheet (PrepSheetView) on the right-hand side.

Agenda stays visible and pinned on the left.

Insights and the Partner Circle (voice circle) remain visible on the right-hand side.

Removed Features

Remove “Generate Call Prep” button.

Remove “Draft Follow-Up” button.

Layout Rules

Left: Agenda list (scrollable).

Center/Right: Call Prep Sheet (when event clicked).

Far Right: Partner Circle docked + Insights cards pinned.

Mobile responsive — Agenda stacks above Call Prep and insights.

Safety / Rollout

Work in a new branch: feat/opus-agenda-ui.

Keep old UI behind a flag: VITE_ENABLE_OPUS_UI=true.

Do not modify or delete backend logic.

If calendar/SFDC lookup fails, still render agenda with basic info.

Implementation Steps

Create new page: pages/OpusAgenda.tsx.

Components:

OpusHeroGreeting.tsx (disappears once Agenda clicked).

OpusAgendaList.tsx (always pinned left, triggers prep sheet).

OpusPrepSheet.tsx (wrapper around PrepSheetView).

OpusInsights.tsx (quota + streaks).

OpusPartnerCircle.tsx (voice circle + drawer with ChatModal).

Wire agenda events:

Click event → PrepSheetView loads for that event with Salesforce context.

If no account found → load prep sheet with notes + default info.

Update App.tsx route:

If VITE_ENABLE_OPUS_UI=true → show OpusAgenda as homepage.

Constraints / Don’ts

Don’t alter backend APIs or OAuth.

Don’t enable Pipeline/Tasks/Coach/Insights yet (Agenda only).

Don’t break existing integrations.
