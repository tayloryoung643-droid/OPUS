App Repl (Agenda → Call Prep Sheet)

Goal: On the Agenda tab, replace the existing call-prep layout with the ultra-minimal version shown in the canvas named “MVP Prep — Ultra-minimal UI Preview.” Keep all existing styles, colors, spacing, and components (same design system + tokens). Only change the layout/structure and the fields rendered.

Requirements (do exactly this)

Do not change global theme or palette.

Reuse existing shadcn/ui components, Tailwind classes, and tokens already used on the Agenda page.

No new color variables, no layout-wide CSS changes.

Replace the current prep sections with the following three blocks only (in this order):

Event header card: tiny header with Event Name, Date & Time, and Attendees.

Event Name (Input)

Date & Time (Input)

Attendees (email “pills” using your existing <Badge variant="secondary" /> + a compact “Add attendee…” <Input>).

Notes (Textarea, short): “Notes (optional, personal scratchpad)”.

Open Call-Prep Canvas (Textarea, tall): placeholder text matches the canvas copy (facts-only guidance, bullets).

Hide all legacy sections (agenda/priorities/risks/questions/templates).

Don’t delete code; gate rendering with a flag so we can re-enable later if needed.

Keep behavior identical elsewhere (tabs, routing, scroll, keyboard focus styles).

Only the contents of the Call Prep sheet area in the Agenda tab change.

Respect existing data flow (read-only for now):

Keep whatever props/state sources power Event Name, Date/Time, and Attendees.

If data is not available, show the exact placeholders from the canvas.

Do not introduce new network calls in this change.

Match the canvas structure closely

Same component types and hierarchy as the canvas preview (Card → CardHeader → CardContent; Inputs; Badges; Textareas).

Same spacing density (rounded-2xl cards, small headers, compact gaps).

Use your existing utility classes; if you need new ones, use the same scale as elsewhere on the Agenda page.

Implementation notes

File(s): Update the component that renders the Agenda → Call Prep pane (e.g., app/(dashboard)/agenda/CallPrep.tsx or equivalent).

Refactor: Extract the new structure into a small presentational component (e.g., CallPrepUltraMinimal) to keep logic separate from layout.

Flags: If you already have PREP_MODE, render this layout when PREP_MODE === "minimal"; otherwise default to current behavior.

Definition of Done

Agenda tab shows only:

Event header card (Event Name, Date/Time, Attendees with pills + “Add attendee…” input)

Notes (short Textarea)

Open Call-Prep Canvas (tall Textarea with facts-only placeholder)

No other sections or template content are visible.

Theme, colors, shadows, radius, and typography unchanged from the rest of the app.

Existing keyboard/focus/hover states still look identical to the rest of the UI.

Placeholders and microcopy match the canvas preview.
