Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, implementing a modern component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The application follows a component-driven design with reusable UI components and specific feature components for call preparation sections (executive summary, CRM history, competitive landscape, etc.).

### Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript in a RESTful API pattern:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type-safe server-side development
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following resource-based URL patterns
- **Middleware**: Custom logging middleware for API request tracking
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

The server architecture separates concerns through distinct layers for routing, data access (storage), and external service integration.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless for scalability
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema-first approach for type safety
- **Schema Design**: Relational design with companies, contacts, calls, and call preparations tables
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management
- **Connection**: Neon serverless with WebSocket support for optimal performance

The database schema supports the core entities: companies (prospect organizations), contacts (stakeholders), calls (scheduled meetings), and call preparations (AI-generated research).

### Authentication and Authorization
The application features comprehensive authentication and integration management:

- **User Authentication**: Google Sign-in via Replit Auth integration using OIDC protocol
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with PostgreSQL session store
- **User Management**: Automatic user profile creation and updates from OAuth claims
- **Route Protection**: Authenticated routes show home dashboard vs landing page for guests
- **Profile Integration**: User profiles include name, email, and profile images from Google

### Google Calendar Integration
Production-ready Google Calendar integration with enterprise-grade security:

- **OAuth Flow**: Complete Google OAuth 2.0 flow with Calendar and Gmail scopes
- **Token Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption for all OAuth tokens stored in database
- **Real-time Sync**: Fetches actual calendar events and displays them on the dashboard
- **Conditional UI**: Home page dynamically shows calendar data when connected or empty state when not
- **Settings Management**: Full integration lifecycle (connect, status checking, disconnect)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of expired tokens with automatic re-authentication prompts
- **Security Compliance**: Encrypted token storage, secure refresh flows, and proper error handling

### Salesforce CRM Integration
Enterprise-grade Salesforce CRM integration for comprehensive sales data access:

- **OAuth Flow**: Complete Salesforce OAuth 2.0 flow with API and refresh token scopes
- **Connected App Security**: Configured with proper OAuth policies (client secret required, PKCE disabled for compatibility)
- **Token Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption for all Salesforce OAuth tokens stored in database
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Works with production, sandbox, and My Domain Salesforce instances
- **CRM Data Access**: Full API access for accounts, contacts, opportunities, and sales data
- **Settings Management**: Complete integration lifecycle (connect, status checking, disconnect)
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of token expiration with automatic re-authentication flows
- **Security Compliance**: Enterprise security with encrypted credential storage and SSRF protection

### External Service Integrations
The platform integrates with external services for enhanced functionality:

- **Google Calendar Integration**: Live calendar event fetching, OAuth token management, and real-time sync
- **Salesforce CRM Integration**: Enterprise-grade CRM data access with full OAuth 2.0 security and encrypted token storage
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT models for generating prospect research, competitive analysis, and conversation strategies
- **AI Research Generation**: Automated creation of executive summaries, CRM history analysis, competitive landscape mapping, and opportunity identification
- **Secure Token Management**: Enterprise-grade encryption for all third-party API credentials
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for external API failures with fallback strategies

The integration layer provides secure, encrypted storage of API credentials and implements proper token refresh flows with automatic re-authentication when needed.
